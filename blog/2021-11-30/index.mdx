This serves as a kind of work diary, noting the interesting tools used,
the problems solved and the things learned. After 7 days I may summarise the posts into 1 post.
I will figure out the format/style/layout later.

I downloaded Ansible, along with Vagrant and VirtualBox, while folling along with
Jeff Geerling's Ansible 101 [youtube playlist](https://youtu.be/goclfp6a2IQ)

After pausing learning about Ansible that one I moved over to picked up a colleague's work and
deployed an Elasticsearch/Kibana/Fluentd stack along our app containers.

I had a slight detour midway through that while trying to help a colleague with test data.
We currently have source data in `src/` and our test data is alongside our unit tests under `tests/`.
The test data is in kdb+ format, which git cannot diff.
* problem 1 - the overhead in modifying the test data
* problem 2 is compounded 1 - when a dev is hoping to merge the test data, there could be conflicts
That brought us to the idea that we may well require two solutions:
* add the ability to write tests with data that can be generated with a function
* write the data in plaintext and transform it into kdb format at run time
