Learned about some new tools from Fireship's 2022 predictions.
Databases:
* mindsdb
* supabase
* planetscale
* redis becoming multi-model
Frontend frameworks:
* svelte and sveltekit
* stackblitz
* nuxt for Vue
* astro
* vite is simpler than webpack
* jetbrains releasing fleet 
* tailwindcss 

I watched an interesting video about the next stage in CI/CD => CI/CD/CC with the introduction of CC where CC is continuous configuration.
AWS reckon it is worthwhile methodology.
The CC software would house, amoung other things, the Feature Access Control (FAC), which is a tool that handles:
* Feature toggling
* A/B testing
* canary & preview release
* etc
The vid also had two nice nuggests (paraphrased):
* You have done nothing until you have released.
* And releasing is just the beginning of the real work.
