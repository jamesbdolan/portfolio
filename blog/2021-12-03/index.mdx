Learned about some new tools from [Fireship's 2022 predictions](https://youtu.be/LOpFYMPXqE4).
Databases:
* mindsdb
* supabase
* planetscale
* redis becoming multi-model
Frontend frameworks:
* svelte and sveltekit
* stackblitz
* nuxt for Vue
* astro
* vite is simpler than webpack
* jetbrains releasing fleet
* tailwindcss

I watched an interesting video about the next stage in CI/CD called CI/CD/CC.
CC is continuous configuration, and AWS reckon it is worthwhile methodology.
The CC would be tools like the Feature Access Control (FAC) which handles:
* Feature toggling
* A/B testing
* Canary & preview release
The video also had two nice nuggests (paraphrased):
* You have done nothing until you have released.
* And releasing is just the beginning of the real work.
