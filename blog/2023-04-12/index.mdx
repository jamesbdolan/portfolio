While watching two videos about DNS ([1](https://youtu.be/HnUDtycXSNE) and [2](https://youtu.be/XeLnBkjdiGo)) I was wondering if I should deploy my own local DNS just to play around, that led me to CoreDNS.

I was also looking at the [root name servers wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server) where I saw CoreDNS again alongside the other DNS software products. I then learned about [CNCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Native_Computing_Foundation#CoreDNS), the foundation that 'incubated' and 'graduated' CoreDNS.
