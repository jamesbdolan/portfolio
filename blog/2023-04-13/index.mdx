I was reading about gRPC, I need to read more to understand fully.
There is a good series [here](https://www.mulesoft.com/api-university/guide-to-grpc-understanding-building-and-using-grpc-apis)

I came across [Kubespray](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/comparisons) and learned about [Operators](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introducing-operators-putting-operational-knowledge-into-software)
