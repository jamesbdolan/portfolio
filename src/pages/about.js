      <p>I never planned on becoming a software engineer. 
        I did an undergrad in physics and did not know what I wanted to do after university. 
        Grass is always greener, but I always regretted not doing engineering. 
        When I landed my first job a few months after graduating, 
        I was quite delighted to finally be an engineer, 
        even if I was 'only' a software engineer.
        I think my goal is to work on software at the human-machine interface, to improve human health.</p>
