      <p>I never planned to work in software.
        I did an undergrad in physics and did not know what to do with it.
        Currently I am a devops engineer for Zinkworks where I work with Ericsson on their orchestration software.
        Since starting this role I have enjoyed learning about telecoms infrastructure</p>
