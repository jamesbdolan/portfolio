<h1>Hello! I'm James, a DevOps engineer in Melbourne</h1>
<p>
    I moved here from Dublin just a couple of weeks ago.
    This site is constantly improving and is here to boost my CV and showcase my skills.
    I took a hiatus from working on this site while I spent the summer with family before moving here.
    I am working through Svelte tutorials given by YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev">Joy of Code</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Huntabyte">Huntabyte</a>.

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The emoji are here to jazz it up 🌸</p>
<ul>
    <li>Site hosting 🌐</li>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Registered a domain name with <a href="id.ie">Irish Domains</a> 🇮🇪</li>
        <li>✅ Pointed my domain to Netlify nameservers 🛣️</li>
        <li>✅ The Netlify build is triggered off commits to the Github repo 🪝</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Become familiar with HTML and CSS</li>
        <ul>
            <li>🔁 Gotten more used to HTML, like remembering where to place the / in a closing tag 😅</li>
            <li>✅ Added a style sheet from <a href="https://picocss.com/docs/">Pico CSS</a> 🎨</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Website analytics 📈</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I tried connecting this site to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> but failed 👺 </li>
            <li>Wondering is it worth using my own database to track analytics? 🤔</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Connect to a database, is this a necessity for a portfolio?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ I tested a Pocketbase instance on a Linode server which worked very nicely </li>
            <li>I like the look of setting up Prisma 😙</li>
            <li>Maybe set up basic database with Prisma then swap to Pocketbase?</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
