<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I never planned to work in software.
    I did an undergrad in physics and did not know what to do with it.
    My most recent role was a devops engineer for Zinkworks where I worked with Ericsson on their orchestration software.
    In that role I really enjoyed learning about telecoms infrastructure</p>
